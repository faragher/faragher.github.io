In what should've been a short and simple process, I am currently better than eight hours into setting up a simple Jekyll install because my Postfix instance was misconfigured. To be fair, I was the one who misconfigured it, but I'm not ready to accept that bit of pain at this time.

In any case, running your own mail server is almost always a mistake. Anything you save in money or gain in control you lose in time.

That being said, "useful" content upcoming.
